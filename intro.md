```

**Example**
```
output/Google/Micah_Braun_SoftwareEngineer.pdf
output/Google/Micah_Braun_SoftwareEngineer.docx
```

 **In the Python script**, you’ll need to:
- Extract organization name from job description input (could be an extra text field).
- Generate filename like `First_Last_JobTitle` (sanitize spaces/special chars).
- Save files inside `output/<Organization>/`.

**Why?**
- Organizes outputs per job application.
- Makes it easy to track multiple tailored resumes.
- Great for showing off organized, scalable solutions in your portfolio.
